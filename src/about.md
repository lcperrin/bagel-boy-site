### Neighborhood roots. Early mornings. Loud music. Bread done right.

Well here’s a little story, I’d like to tell, about two young brothers, you known so well. It started way back in history, it’s L-dot, and my man Nate D!

Just kidding, we're two buddies that came up in Portland when it was Art and Food, and Fun.  We're trying to bring that element back by hand-making the most delicious breads you've ever had (probably.)

I can't gaurantee these breads will be gluten or allergen free, but I can gaurantee that each one will be made with a careful consideration of ingredients, with preference given to local suppliers whenever possible.
